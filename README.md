# bg3-mod-tools
Various scripts and utilities for working with game assets for Baldurs Gate 3

Using Norbytes previous work in https://github.com/Norbyte/lslib as reference, I've created a few very simple python scripts to work specifically with the BG3 assets.

The main desire was to have native-ish tools/scripts running on MacOS, because that's my developer environment.  I had 2 options:

1.  Convert Norbyte's C# project over to mono
2.  Just convert it to a script

I've never been a fan of IDE build projects, so I went the second route.
